Her teaching is grounded in extensive real-world legal practice, particularly in contracts drafting, commercial litigation, transactional counseling, and mergers and acquisitions. She brings to the classroom deep experience analyzing, drafting, and negotiating complex agreements; assessing contractual risk; resolving disputes arising from failed transactions; and advising clients through deal structuring, due diligence, and post-closing issues.\n\nBefore entering full-time academia, Professor Williams practiced law in multiple common-law jurisdictions, where her work included contract formation and enforcement, business litigation, transactional planning, and corporate governance matters, including issues commonly arising in mergers, acquisitions, and strategic partnerships. This background informs her emphasis on precision in drafting, clarity in deal terms, and strategic thinking in both litigation and transactional settings. Her courses consistently integrate contract doctrine with practical drafting exercises, deal simulations, and litigation-based problem solving.\n\nIn addition to her teaching, Professor Williams has held numerous academic and senior administrative leadership roles nationwide. Her experience includes serving as Vice President of Institutional Advancement at Wilberforce University; Assistant to the Dean and Adjunct Professor at the University of Mississippi School of Law; Director of Admissions and Special Programs at the University of Florida College of Law; Vice President of Student Affairs at Edward Waters College; Assistant Professor in the Center for Academic & Bar Readiness at the University of La Verne College of Law; and Associate Professor and Academic Dean at Arizona Summit School of Law.

She regularly conducts workshops and CLE programs focused on negotiation effectiveness, client communication, leadership under pressure, ethical decision-making, and conflict management—skills that are especially critical in high-stakes contract negotiations and complex business transactions.\n\nHer commitment to service is extensive. Professor Williams has dedicated significant time to community engagement, pro bono advocacy, and civic leadership, including advising the Arizona Summit School of Law Family Advocacy Pro Bono Project, in partnership with the Salvation Army's Elim House and the Volunteer Lawyers Project of Maricopa County, where she supported survivors of domestic violence. She has also served on the board of Literacy Volunteers of Maricopa County and supported numerous community organizations, including Habitat for Humanity, Boys & Girls Club, Phoenix Rescue Mission, and youth and professional development initiatives.\n\nA native of Gretna, Louisiana, Professor Williams remains deeply committed to the recovery and resilience of the Greater New Orleans region, particularly in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and subsequent natural disasters, through continued service with Habitat for Humanity and community-based advocacy programs.\n\nProfessor Williams's research and scholarship focus on contracts, emotional intelligence and the law, transactional skills development, diversity and equity in legal education, women's rights, and the intersection of law, leadership, and professional identity. She is a member of the Louisiana State Bar Association and the National Bar Association, and has been a proud member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. for more than 30 years.",
